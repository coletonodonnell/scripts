# scripts
Some dirty scripts I have written to complete some tasks.

- `bulk_analyze_audio.py`
A simple script that exports the spectograms of music files in bulk. Requires ffmpeg.

- `dwm-bar.py`
What I use to print system info on my dwm status bar. In order it prints my zfs pool info (only supports one pool), the load average and temperature of my CPU, the date, time, and then finally uptime.
